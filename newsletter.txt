For the last four weeks, the School of Mathematics has hosted a comprehensive school student who has undertaken a research placement with myself and Dr. Vincent Knight. Cindy Huang joined us in extending some queueing models of deadlocking queueing networks. The placement was part of the Nuffield Foundation's Research Placement scheme (http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org), which gives students studying in their first year of post-16 science the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research with professional scientists, engineers and mathematicians.

Cindy's work involved investigating the phenomenon of deadlock in queueing network, using both simulation and analytical techniques. Her work first looked at customers who baulk (decide not to join a queue as it is too long), and how this effects the expected time until the system reaches deadlock. This involved adapting Markov chain formulations and manipulating Markov chains, as well as running computer simulations of the system. The work then moved on to look at the effect of scheduled vacations (where servers periodically go off duty, or on vacation) on the time to deadlock. This was done through investigating time inhomogeneous Markov chains and running numerical experiments on these.

The four week placement introduced Cindy to programming, especially the Python language; advanced mathematical techniques in operational research; and new previously uninvestigated problems in queueing theory. Cindy can now look forward to a presentation evening in the near future where she will present this work in the form of a poster to other Nuffield placement students from a variety of STEM fields. Well done Cindy, and good luck!
